# Guidelines to the project

Before you start: YOU DON’T HAVE TO WRITE ANY CSS ! All the required css is written and ready to be used. You only need to add the required class names

- Look at this [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/w4Y3CAniWAcDYqp0T41Rop/simple-landing-page?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=zjHDVc17WXVS49kf-0)
- Download / Clone this repo
- Add the required classes to the second section of the home page so it shows as in the maquette
- Add the correct footer class to the footer element
- On the “about” page add the right classes
- in the `script.js` create a code to hide or show the class “header-open” (toggle)
- You can customise the site by changing these css varaibles found on the file `css/variables.css`
- Add your project to Github and deploy it. [Here’s a guide](https://www.notion.so/Github-517fb95f655b42a4892ac40b596ba322) on how to do that, in case you need it

## Good luck and may the Force be wit you !
